<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Introduction</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The document you have on your screen right now is a set of instructions that will allow you to set up and run combat encounters for the purpose of playtesting Last Odyssey's combat system.  There will be other rules written down in this document that do not pertain to combat, but they are works in progress.  They are not meant to be tested at present, as they are not fully connected to their intended context.  That being said, feedback on them is welcome if you have any.</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Characters in Combat</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A discrete instance of combat in Last Odyssey is called a battle.  Any agent that can act during battles is called a character.  The capabilities of a character during battle are represented by their attributes, their statistics, and their abilities.  An attribute is a number from one to ten that represents how strong a character is in a general domain of aptitudes.  A statistic is also a number, but is much less abstract, instead representing a specific capability in combat.  Finally, abilities are discrete actions that characters can take during combat that supplement the actions that all characters can take.  The abilities a player character can use are determined by the job they occupy and its current rank, their class, their items, their equipment, and whatever flex powers they take during character advancement.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Throughout these rules you will sometimes see numbers such as damage or statistics be referred to as </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">base</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> numbers.  A number that is base has not been modified by any situation-specific bonuses or penalties.  For example, the base damage of an attack is the damage that it would do to its target if there were no elemental or type modifiers involved, while the base Evasion of a character is what their Evasion is without any applied buffs, debuffs, status effects, or other situational modifiers.  See the Combat Rules section for more details.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's stamina in battle is represented by two scores, their Hit Points and their Mana Points.  Throughout these rules, these will be shortened to HP and MP, respectively.  When a character is hit with an ability that counts as a physical attack or magical attack, their HP is reduced by the calculated damage number associated with the ability and the statistics of both the attacker and their target.  When a character uses an ability that has an MP cost, their MP is reduced by that amount.  Characters may never use an ability that costs more than their current MP.  A character's MP can never be below zero.  If it is reduced to zero, they cannot use abilities that cost MP, with the exception of if they are Sages and still possess Spell Slots.  If a character's HP is reduced to zero or below, they are referred to as being downed.  A downed character cannot act and cannot be the target of more effects.  See the Death and Injury section for more details.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Attributes:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Body.  A character's Body is a measure of how adept they are at pushing their athletic abilities to the limit, from hand-eye coordination to endurance running.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mind.  A character's Mind is a measure of how quick and able they are at intellectually challenging tasks, from logical debate to solving mathematical puzzles.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Spirit.  A character's Spirit is a representation of their strength of personality.  This governs their aptitude for social interactions, as well as their ability to empathize with others.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Statistics:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Initiative.  A character's Initiative determines when they act in combat.  The higher their Initiative is, the sooner they act.  Their base Initiative is equal to their Mind times 2 plus the bonus they receive from their class at Tier 1.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Health.  A character's Health is their base maximum HP during combat.  It is equal to their Body times 5 plus the bonus they receive from their class at Tier 1.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mana.  A character's Mana is their base maximum MP during combat.  It is equal to their Spirit times 5 plus the bonus they receive from their class at Tier 1.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Attack.  Any physical attacks a character makes deal a base amount of damage that is increased by their Physical Attack unless otherwise specified.  A character's base Physical Attack is equal to the bonus given by their equipped weapon plus the bonus applied by their current job if there is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Attack.  Any magical attacks a character makes deal a base amount of damage that is increased by their Magical Attack unless otherwise specified.  A character's base Magical Attack is equal to the bonus given by their equipped weapon plus the bonus applied by their current job if there is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Defense.  Any physical damage a character receives is reduced by their Physical Defense.  A character's base Physical Defense is equal to the bonus from their equipped armor plus the bonus from their current job if there is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Defense.  Any magical damage a character receives is reduced by their Magical Defense.  A character's base Magical Defense is equal to the bonus from their equipped armor plus the bonus from their current job if there is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Evasion.  A character's Evasion reduces the likelihood that they will be hit by either a physical or magical attack.  A character's base Evasion is equal to the bonus from their equipped accessories plus the bonus from their current job if their is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Resistance.  A character's Resistance increases the likelihood that they will resist status-inflicting abilties.  A character's base Resistance is equal to the bonus from their equipped accessories plus the bonus from their current job if their is one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Accuracy.  A character's Physical Accuracy increases their likelihood to hit an enemy with a physical attack.  Their base Physical Accuracy is equal to their Mind plus their Body.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Accuracy.  A character's Magical Accuracy increases their likelihood to hit an enemy with a magical attack.  Their base Magical Accuracy is equal to their Spirit plus their Mind.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Status Accuracy.  A character's Status Accuracy increases their likelihood to inflict negative statuses on their targets.  Their base Status Accuracy is equal to their Body plus their Spirit.</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Combat</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All instances of violent combat involving the player characters in Last Odyssey are referred to as battles.  Each battle takes place between two opposing sides, with the player characters and their allies on one side and their enemies on the other.  Any elements of the battlefield that cannot act by themselves can still be interacted with by characters that use the Interact action.  The effects of the Interact action always trigger during the Effect Phase of the battle.  See the Actions, Turns, and Rounds section for more details.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Starting a Battle</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the beginning of every battle, note every character participating in the battle, and mark down which side they are on, the players' or their enemies'.  Neither side can move to the other side's part of the battlefield for the duration of combat.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are two possible rows that a character can occupy on each side of the battle: the front row and the back row.  At the beginning of the battle, each player chooses which row their character occupies, and the GM determines which rows their enemies and allies start on.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Enemies and allies in the front row of their respective sides may be targeted by any kind of attack or ability, and may also make any kind of attack or use any kind of ability.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Enemies and allies in the back row may not target enemies with any melee abilities, and also cannot be targeted by enemy melee abilities.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once you have determined the starting location of every character on the battlefield, you may now determine the initiative order.  The initiative order is the order in which each character acts during a round.  The higher on the initiative order they are, the sooner they act.  The act of determining the initiative order during combat is referred to as </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">calling initiative</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">.  To call initiative, each player calls out a number between 1 and 8.  The lower the number is, the more likely it is that the player will go first on a tie.  The higher the number is, the more likely it is that the player will go last on a tie.  Players who call out a 1 are guaranteed to go first on a tie.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once all players have called their numbers, the GM rolls 2d4 and reads out the result.  Players who called a number equal to the number that the GM rolled count as having an Initiative of 1.5x its base value for the rest of the battle.  Players who called a number equal to or above the number the GM rolled will always act last on a tie with an enemy, while players who called a number below the number the GM rolled will always act first on a tie with an enemy.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once Initiative has been called, compare the modified Initiative scores of all of the characters in the battle and rank them from lowest to highest.  The order in which the characters will act every round starts with the character with the highest Initiative score for the battle and goes in order of descending Initiative until it ends with the character with the lowest Initiative score for the battle.  Ties between player characters and their enemies are resolved based on the results of calling initiative, ties between player characters are resolved by player fiat, and ties between enemies are resolved by GM fiat.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The last step before the first round of a battle begins is the first Paradigm Phase of the battle.  During the paradigm phase, each player should choose what job their character will occupy during the first round.  They may choose to change this at the end of each subsequent round.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In some battles, such as when one side is ambushed, either the players or their enemies will have an extra turn at the beginning of a round called the First Strike.  During the First Strike, the side that has the upper hand will be able to take a free turn before the players call initiative.  The order in which characters act during the First Strike is determined by the players if they have the upper hand, and the GM if their enemies do.  During the First Strike round, all characters on the side that has the upper hand have only 1 AP instead of their usual 2 or 3.  During a battle where the players have the First Strike, the first Paradigm Phase triggers before the First Strike round commences, and the second Paradigm Phase occurs right before the beginning of the first round.  Once the First Strike round is over, call initiative as normal.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Actions, Turns, and Rounds</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The standard unit of time that each battle is divided into is known as a round.  After the initiative order is determined and all other pre-battle steps are taken into consideration, the first round of combat begins.  This round, and each subsequent round, are divided into three phases:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Action Phase.  This is the phase in which each character on the field takes their turn in the order determined by their respective Initiatives.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Effect Phase.  This is the phase in which any environmental effects not caused by abilities take place, such as the turning of a boat or lightning striking one of the characters.  This is also the phase in which either side can Advance if the situation is appropriate.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Paradigm Phase.  During this phase, each player on the field can choose to switch jobs.  Doing so does changes out the bonuses to their statistics but does not affect any abilities that are already in play, such as the Defender's Taunt or the Saboteur's status effects.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sometimes, multiple effects can occur at once during the Effect Phase.  When this happens, damage takes precedent, followed by healing, followed by status effects, followed by everything else.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The time during a round when a given character is allowed to act is called their turn.  Each action you take costs an amount of a resource called Action Points, or AP for short that depends on the type of action you are taking.  Once you run out of Action Points during your turn, your turn ends and the turn of the character next in the initiative order begins.  If there are no characters left in the initiative order, the round enters the Effect Phase.  Characters of tier 1-5 have 2 AP per turn, while characters of tier 6-10 have 3 AP per turn.  Most actions cost 1 AP unless otherwise specified.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">During the Effect Phase, if there are no characters in the front row on one or both sides of combat, then their opponents can choose to Advance.  When they do so, all of the characters on the opposing side now count as being in the front row instead of the back row.  If both sides are in the back row during the Effect Phase, the players choose whether or not to Advance before their enemies do.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">On a character's turn, they are limited to performing the following actions:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Basic Attack.  The character makes a colorless physical attack against a single enemy.  This does base physical attack damage as outlined in the next section.  No matter what, this attack always counts as a melee attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Use Ability.  The character uses one of their abilities.  Some abilities have an MP cost, which reduces the character's MP by the stated amount after the ability is used.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Use Item.  A character may spend 1 AP to use one of the items in the party inventory on a target or targets of their choice.  Once an item is used, it is permanently removed from the party inventory.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Move.  A character may move from their front row to their back row, or from their back row to their front row at the cost of 1 AP.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Summon Eidolon.  A character may expend 3 Anima to summon their Eidolon.  This does not cost any AP.  When they do so, neither they nor their allies are able to act but also cannot be targeted by enemies until the Eidolon disappears.  At the beginning of each subsequent round that a character's Eidolon is in play, they must spend 1 Anima to keep the Eidolon on the field.  Otherwise, it disappears, and all characters are able to act again as normal.  If the Eidolon drops to zero HP, it also disappears, and all characters are able to act again as normal.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Hold AP.  During your turn, you may spend one of your remaining AP to designate it as held.  When you do so, choose a character that is acting after you in the Initiative order.  You will have an extra turn after that character's called a held turn in which you have only 1 AP to act.  You cannot hold more than 1 AP at a time, and you cannot hold AP on your extra turn.  In other words, you can only hold 1 AP once per round.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">End Turn.  If you still have AP remaining, you can choose to end your turn early without acting.  You will lose your remaining non-held AP, but you will still get the chance to act on your held turn if you have one.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Interact.  During some battles, there will be contextual objects that players can interact with.  If they do so, they must use the Interact action.  Performing simple actions, such as flipping a switch, asking a question, or breaking a window, requires 1 AP, while performing more complex actions, such as logging into a computer or lowering a drawbridge, may require an entire turn or more to complete.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Swap Equipment.  You can spend an AP to put your weapon away, equip a weapon you are proficient with from your inventory, take an accessory off, or put an accessory from your inventory on.  You cannot take armor on or off during battle.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Flee.  If you still have AP left, you can end your turn immediately to flee the battle.  If you do so, you leave the battlefield at the end of the Effect Phase, and can no longer act or be acted upon by any of the remaining characters.  If all player characters flee, the battle ends, and you do not gain any XP or items.  What happens after player characters flee and whether or not they can flee in the first place is up to the GM's discretion.  Flee cannot be used by characters that occupy the front row.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Attacking and Defending</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Some character abilities, such as buffs and debuffs, succeed no matter what.  However, there are three types of abilities that can fail to activate their effects: physical attacks, magical attacks, and status-inflicting abilities.  The same mechanics listed below for player characters and their allies targeting enemies also apply to enemies targeting player characters or their allies.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Attacks.  When you make a physical attack against an enemy or enemies, roll a 1d10, subtract your Physical Accuracy from the result, and then add your opponent's Evasion.  If the resulting number is equal to a 7 or below, you hit and deal damage that reduces the target's total HP.  Otherwise, you miss and deal no damage.  The base damage of the attack is equal to your Physical Attack minus the enemy's Physical Defense plus the result of the 1d10 roll you made earlier multiplied by any relevant damage modifiers.  Against multiple enemies, you only roll the 1d10 once, and use the resulting number to determine whether you hit and the base damage you deal against each one separately.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Attacks.  When you make a physical attack against an enemy or enemies, roll a 1d10, subtract your Magical Accuracy from the result, and then add your opponent's Evasion.  If the resulting number is equal to a 7 or below, you hit and deal damage that reduces the target's total HP.  Otherwise, you miss and deal no damage.  The base damage of the attack is equal to your Magical Attack minus the enemy's Magical Defense plus the result of the 1d10 roll you made earlier multiplied by any relevant damage modifiers.  Against multiple enemies, you only roll the 1d10 once, and use the resulting number to determine whether you hit and the base damage you deal against each one separately.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Status-Inflicting Abilities.  When you use a status-inflicting ability on an enemy, roll a 1d10 and subtract your Status Accuracy from the result.  To determine whether or not each enemy is hit, add their Resistance to the result of your roll.  If the result is equal to or below a 5, they gain the status effect you are attempting to inflict.  Against multiple enemies, you only roll the 1d10 once, and use the resulting number to determine whether you successfully inflict the status against each one individually.  See the Status Effects section for more details.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The minimum amount of base damage you deal with an attack is 1.  However, the base damage you deal is not equal to the final damage the enemy takes.  Instead, the final damage they take is equal to the base damage of the attack multiplied by any relevant modifiers.  When a character makes a magical attack against an opponent that has a Shell active, they do double damage.  Likewise, when a character makes a physical attack against an opponent that does not have a Shell active, they also do double damage.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Some attacks that you make, such as Cleave or Elemental Storm, will target multiple characters at once.  When you make one of these attacks, you only make one attack roll and subtract the corresponding accuracy bonus from it.  However, to determine whether or not you hit each enemy and whether or not you deal damage if applicable, you should subtract each enemy's Evasion or Resistance from and add their defense stats to your roll independently of one another.  For example, let's say you have a Physical Accuracy of 3 and a Physical Attack of 2.  You attack two enemies, and roll a 5 on your 1d10, meaning that your accuracy result is a 2 and your damage result is a 7.  The first enemy has an Evasion of 6 and a Physical Defense of 1, so you miss against them.  The second enemy has an Evasion of 2 and a Physical Defense of 3, so your attack hits them with a base damage of 4.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every ability that you use has a target.  Abilities that target the Self only affect the character using them, abilities that are Melee can only be used from the front row and can only target enemies in the front row, abilities that are Ranged can be used from any row and can target any character on the field, and abilities that are Special have fixed targets that are specified in the ability description.  Abilities marked as Passive do not have a range, since they do not have any targets, and abilities marked as Ally will target you or an ally.  Finally, abilities marked Multi can target multiple characters depending on the description of the ability, and abilities marked Reaction will specifically target a character that has taken a specific action or has just fulfilled a specific requirement.  </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You may also use Ally abilities on enemies if you so choose.  In this case, they count as being Ranged.</em></i></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Damage</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Many attacks and all status effects have an associated element.  If this is the case, the damage that the attack does is multiplied by an amount determined by both the element of the attack and the element of the target.  An attack or character that does not have an elemental type is referred to as colorless.  Unless they have a Shell active, player characters count as colorless for the purpose of calculating the damage they take from enemy attacks.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are nine elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Light, Cold, Metal, Thunder, Shadow and Wood.  Fire, Water, and Earth are called primal elements, while the other six are called natural elements.  In general, natural elements have the potential to deal more damage but also receive more damage than primal elements.  An attack of a given elemental type will have its damage multiplied by a number determined by the elemental type of the target.  Characters with a Shell active will count as being of the Shell's element for the purposes of calculating how much damage they receive.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you are trying to determine the elemental modifier for a particular attack, consult the table below by finding the elemental type of the attack listed in the left-hand column and matching it with the elemental type of the target on the top row.  The correct multiplier is at the cell at the intersection of the row the attacker's element occupies and the column the defender's element occupies.  If either the attack or the target are colorless, the elemental multiplier is automatically equal to one.  When the resulting damage that a character takes after all multipliers are taken into account is not equal to an integer, round that number down to the nearest integer.  For example, if a character takes 2.5 damage according to the elemental table, this only counts as taking 2 damage in practice.</span></p><table><colgroup><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col><col></colgroup><tbody><tr dir="ltr"><td style="width: 81px;

Abilities that inflict status effects on a target also have an associated element.  Unlike damaging abilities, however, elemental resistances do not change the actual effect of the ability.  Instead, they change the probability that the target will receive the status effect at all.  When a character uses a status-inflicting ability against another character on the battlefield, consult the element table in the last section, with the element associated with the power on the left-hand column and the element of the target on the top.  The associated multiplier does not change the quality of the status effect, but instead the probability as follows:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">0.25x.  The target is immune to this status effect.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">0.5x.  The status effect is inflicted when the result of the status-inflicting ability roll is 3 or below instead of 5 or below.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">2x.  The status effect is inflicted when the result of the status-inflicting ability roll is 7 or below instead of 5 or below.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">4x.  The target cannot evade this status effect.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There is no such thing as a colorless status effect.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are nine status effects in total, one for each element.  The status effects and their corresponding elements are listed below.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Fire: Burn.  The affected character cannot receive any healing and cannot be buffed while this status is active.  Any buffs they have already received remain active until otherwise removed.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Water: Confusion.  When a character becomes Confused, assign each character on the battlefield a number in ascending order, with the Confused character assigned a 1.  When that character uses an ability, attacks, or uses an item, flip a coin and make their player call heads or tails.  If they call right, their ability targets the character they want to target.  If they call wrong, roll a die with a number of sides greater than or equal to the number of characters on the field.  The target of the ability will then be the character associated with that number.  If the target is out of range of the ability, make this roll again until you land on a character who is.  Melee attacks can target all allies, and ally abilities can target all enemies.  Multi abilities will target all characters on the side of the character who is the designated target.  Characters can additionally target themselves with offensive abilities due to this attack.  Non-player characters with this condition call a side of the coin determined by the GM.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Earth: Petrify.  The affected character is unable to use the Move action, and their base Evasion counts as being half its current value rounded down, including buffs and debuffs.  If the value is negative, it is not reduced in this manner.  They may still Advance as normal.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Light: Blind.  The affected character's Accuracy values count as half their base value (counting bonuses from equipment) rounded down.  Buffs and debuffs to this value still apply as normal.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cold: Frostbite.  The affected character is unable to use their basic attack, use items, or use any abilities that restore Health or Mana.  Any abilities they have that heal passively, such as the Priest's Prayer or the Auto Heal equipment power, are not negated by this status effect.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Metal: Fatigue.  When the affected character uses an ability that costs MP, the total MP cost they pay to use said ability is doubled.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Thunder: Paralysis.  Any physical attack rolls the character makes automatically fail.  This includes basic attacks or counterattacks due to item or job abilities.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shadow: Silence.  Any magical attack rolls the character makes automatically fail.  This includes basic attacks or counterattacks due to item or job abilities.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Wood: Toxin.  During the Effect Phase at the end of a round, this character takes damage equal to one tenth of their base maximum HP rounded down with a minimum damage of 1, not counting any buffs or debuffs but still counting modifiers from equipment.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Buffs and Debuffs</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Some abilities modify the statistics of their target.  Abilities that increase a target's statistics are called buffs, while abilities that decrease their statistics are called debuffs.  When you use a buff or debuff on a character, it does not increase or reduce the statistic directly.  Instead, it moves that statistic up and down something called the Bonus Tracker.  By default, the bonus to each of a character's statistics is +0.  A single level of buff applied to that statistic gives it a bonus of +1 for the duration of the battle.  Another level raises this bonus to +3, and the final level raises it to +7.  Subsequent buffs do nothing.  Likewise, a single level of a debuff on a statistic imposes a penalty of -1, a second level imposes a penalty of -3, and a third will impose a penalty of -7.  Further debuffs do nothing.  In addition, buffs and debuffs are capable of cancelling each other out.  One level of buff will cancel out one level of debuff, and vice versa.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Another way of putting the above is that each level of buff raises the statistic one level up the Bonus Tracker, and each level of debuff lowers the statistic one level down.  There are seven levels on the Bonus Tracker in total, corresponding to additive modifiers of -7, -3, -1, +0, +1, +3, and +7.  All character statistics start in the middle of the Bonus Tracker at +0, and return to the middle at the end of every battle.  Buffs and debuffs cannot be resisted, although some passive equipment bonuses and monster abilities will render a character immune to certain buffs and/or debuffs.  Character statistics can be buffed and debuffed to any value, including negative ones.  The exceptions to this are a character's maximum HP and maximum MP, which both have a minimum value of 1.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shells</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Most enemies and any characters that have had a Shell ability used on them have a special status effect known as a Shell.  A Shell is a pool of temporary HP that has a fixed elemental affinity, and can be colorless as well.  When a character's Shell is active, they will take double damage from all magical attacks.  In addition, when determining the elemental modifier to the damage they take or to their status effect modifier, you should take the target's elemental type to be the element of the Shell.  No character with the exception of some Bosses may have more than one Shell of a given type active at a time, and no player character may ever have a Shell that has more HP than their base Health.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When a character's Shell is reduced to zero, they are referred to as Shellbroken.  Characters who are Shellbroken take double damage from physical attacks.  Characters who have not had a Shell applied to them during the battle also take double damage from physical attacks, per the Attacking and Defending section.  When a character's Shell is first broken by an attack, subtract the amount of damage the attack did to the character's Shell from the total final damage of the attack, modifiers included.  If the resulting number is greater than the character's remaining HP, the character is downed.  If the resulting number is less than the character's remaining HP, they do not take any additional damage.  Damage dealt in this way is referred to as overflow damage.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Death and Injury</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When a character drops to 0 HP or below inside of combat, they are considered downed.  When a character is downed, all of the effects applied to them automatically go away, including buffs, debuffs, Haste, Slow, status effects, and Shells, with the exception of Toxin, Frostbite, and Burn.  They cannot act, and cannot be the target of any actions except those that revive them.  When they are revived during the battle, they take the place they previously occupied in the Initiative order, and will act on the first turn they have after the turn of the character that revived them.  However, when they are downed they also lose the opportunity to act on their held turn regardless of whether or not they are revived before it.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If a downed character is not revived before the end of a battle, they will come back to life at 1 HP after the battle is over but at the cost of sustaining an injury.  When this happens, roll a 1d12 and consult the table below to determine the effect.</span></p><ol><li value="1" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's max HP is reduced by 5.</span></li><li value="2" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's max MP is reduced by 5.</span></li><li value="3" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Initiative is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="4" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Physical Attack is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="5" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Magical Attack is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="6" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Physical Defense is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="7" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Magical Defense is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="8" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Evasion is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="9" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Resistance is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="10" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Physical Accuracy is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="11" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Magic Accuracy is reduced by 1.</span></li><li value="12" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The character's Status Accuracy is reduced by 1.</span></li></ol><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character can theoretically sustain an infinite number of injuries in battle.  Still, no injury can ever reduce their HP or MP below 1, and can never reduce their statistics below 0.  While a character is traveling, other characters can heal their injuries by treating them during the Camping Phase of each round of travel.  Otherwise, in order to have their injuries treated, characters must either pay a healer for services or rest in a proper shelter.  If a character is doing the latter, they will recover one injury per night rested in the order they received them.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character cannot be reduced below 1 HP outside of combat.  However, they can still sustain injuries if they take additional damage while they are at 1 HP.  In general, they will take one additional injury every time they take damage that would make them drop to 0.  The exception to this is when they are killed by either a Villain or Monster.  If so, then they can permanently die, and must be resurrected at a temple (rules for this will be discussed further in the travel section).</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Paradigms</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As each player character levels up, they will unlock and advance their rank in six different jobs: Striker, Caster, Healer, Defender, Support, and Saboteur.  During battle, they may choose to switch which job they occupy during the Paradigm Phase.  Any character can switch to any job they have already unlocked with no restrictions except that they may only do it during this phase or outside of combat.  When they do so, they should remove the bonuses to their statistics that the previous job they occupied conferred, and add the bonuses to their statistics that their new job confers.  In addition, they are only able to use the abilities they have unlocked in a particular job when they occupy it, and cannot switch jobs at any time in battle apart from during the Paradigm Phase.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When the players switch jobs in combat, this is called a paradigm shift.  A specific combination of player characters and jobs is known as a paradigm.  There is no limit other than the absolute combinatorial limit to the number of paradigms a party can possibly occupy.  However, players are encouraged to experiment with effective paradigms and to name and record their favorites so that they can plan strategies for future battles.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ending Combat</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A battle is over when one of the two opposing sides has no active characters remaining on the field.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If the players have all been downed or killed, the party will lose something important before they come to.  For example, a group of robbers will steal all of their cr, a group of wolves might eat all of their supplies, and a monster might kidnap  them and drag them into their lair.  Permanently killing a group is impossible with the exception of fights with Villains or Monsters, and even then requires the expenditure of Anima.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end of a battle, every downed enemy will grant the entire party Experience, shortened to XP in the rest of the rulebook, and also award them items.  By default, each downed enemy in combat awards 1 XP to each member of the party regardless of that enemy's tier.  Elite enemies are worth 5 XP, and Bosses are worth 10 XP per phase.  If the players successfully flee a battle, they do not receive any rewards.  However, if their enemies successfully flee, the players still receive the rewards for any enemies they downed before the rest fled.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition to earned XP, each defeated enemy drops an item from its Item Table, while Boss enemies will drop a single piece of equipment plus two items from their Item Table.  The Item Table is a list of three possible items that an enemy can drop, each of which is assigned a number from 1 to 3.  To determine which item an enemy drops, the GM rolls a d4.  The value they roll corresponds to the item the enemy drops.  If the GM rolls a 4, the enemy does not drop an item.  Stealing from an enemy has the opportunity to grant up to one additional item to the party per enemy.  See the Thief rules for more details.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At the end of a battle, most status effects and all buffs, debuffs, Shells, and other effects are removed from all characters that participated.  However, certain status effects can linger on characters between battles depending on which status effect was inflicted.  Otherwise, they stop as soon as the battle is over.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Burn: Burns remain after combat, but can be healed by a full night of rest.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Toxin: At the end of every travel round, characters inflicted with Toxin must roll a 1d10 and add their Resistance to the result.  If the result is below a 5, they take damage equal to one tenth of their max HP, rounded down, with a minimum damage of 1.  If the result is above a 5, the Toxin goes into remission and they stop taking damage.  Toxin is cured by a full night of rest, but if another battle starts before they are cured then they start taking damage every combat round again, and will start taking damage every travel round again after the battle is over.  The damage done by Toxin outside of combat cannot ever cause a character to drop below 1 HP.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Frostbite: Frostbite remains after combat, but can be healed by resting next to a significant heat source (including a warm or hot climate, or a campfire).  Resting in the cold does not count.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All other status effects not listed go away after the end of a battle.</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Character Creation Overview</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last Odyssey has the structure of other conventional tabletop roleplaying games in that each player takes control of a single character called a player character.  A group of player characters is called a party.  The role of the party is to be agents in the world, taking quests, going new places, and driving change.  As they continue on in the campaign, they will grow stronger and pick up new items and equipment.  The basic measure of a character's strength is a number called their tier, which goes from 1 all the way up to 10.  In the following section, I will outline the process for making a new character to join the party which starts at tier 1 with no upgrades.  For characters beyond tier 1, see the Character Advancement section.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Creating Character Concept</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While much of what is on their character sheet determines how they perform in combat, characters in Last Odyssey are more than just chess pieces on a board or gladiators made to bleed and die in battle, but are also fully fledged human beings in their own right.  Therefore, the first thing you should do before you write down any numbers is think a little bit about what kind of person your character is.  When you have a general idea of their personality and appearance, write down a few sentences describing who they might be.  These can be as detailed or as vague as you like.  However, there are two mandatory parts to your character concept that you should decide before moving forward.  The first of these is their Ideal, which is the type of person that they strive to be.  The second of these is their Shadow, which is the type of person they strive </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">not</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> to be.  Note that these do not necessarily have to be good or bad in an objective sense, nor do they necessarily have to be opposites.  A character who wants to be strong, confident, and unflappable might avoid being compassionate in situations that call for it, or might want to be brave without becoming arrogant or foolhardy.  While you can be as detailed as you like, characters' Ideals and Shadows are how they earn Anima during the campaign, so they should at the very least indicate what behavior a character wants to avoid and what behavior a character wants to emulate.  After you have written a sentence or two describing both, you have enough to count as a concept.  Before moving on, you should also name your character and give a brief description of their appearance.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Setting Attributes</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After you have made your character concept, the next step is to determine your character's attributes.  These will also determine their starting statistics.  You can read more about them in the Characters in Combat section.  What they do partially depends on your selected job, but each one also contributes to three statistics no matter what:</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Body contributes to a character's Health, Physical Accuracy, and Status Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mind contributes to a character's Initiative, Magical Accuracy, and Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Spirit contributes to a character's Mana, Status Accuracy, and Magical Accuracy.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Players do not have total freedom to set these stats at the beginning of the game.  If you want a more balanced character, set all three to 2.  If you want a character that has more Health, Initiative, or Mana, set one of their attributes to 3, another to 2, and another to 1.  There are no other options for attribute arrays at character creation.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Choosing Class</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's class is a single title that summarizes their professional background.  Class abilities are utility powers that give characters an extra edge in and out of combat.  In Last Odyssey, there are nine total classes that players can choose from.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rangers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are wilderness experts who specialize in targeting individual enemies and rendering them more vulnerable to being hit.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Thieves</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are criminals and spies who can steal items from enemies in battle and use stealth to gain the upper hand.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Artificers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are scientific experts that augment their magic with items and their items with magic.  They can also gain more information about enemies in combat.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sages</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are experts in spellcasting that can use Spell Slots to rely more heavily on their magical attacks as well as counter enemy attacks.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Priests</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are religious leaders and icons that can restore their allies' MP as well as provide passive healing during combat.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Dancers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> use the magic of art and performance to support their allies and defeat enemies.  In combat, they can copy other characters' powers and change their elemental type at will.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Knights</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> swear loyalty to a cause, whether that be a political movement, a knightly order, or a deity.  In combat, they are physical specialists that also have a bonus to their mobility.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Commanders</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> lead their allies from the back or the front, using their given rank to their advantage.  They can give Orders to other player characters to allow them to act outside of the Initiative order.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Harlequins</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> are tricksters, con artists, and gamblers.  In combat, they can manipulate the winds of fate to inflict random effects in order to gain the upper hand.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you choose your class, it will determine several aspects of your character, some of which will also be relevant later.  You should record them now.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Armor Proficiency.  A character's armor proficiency is what type of armor they can wear.  At character creation, your character starts with a Mundane piece of that type of armor equipped.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Weapon Proficiency.  A character's weapon proficiency is what type of weapon they can wield.  At character creation, your character starts with a Mundane piece of that type of weapon equipped.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Buff.  This sets the statistic that the character buffs when they occupy the Support job.  Later on, they will also gain permanent bonuses to it when they increase their Rank.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Debuff.  This sets the statistic that the character debuffs when they occupy the Saboteur job.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Stat Bonuses.  These are extra bonuses to the character's Health, Initiative, and Mana that their class gives in addition to the numbers determined by their Body, Mind, and Spirit.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In addition to the above, a character's class also provides them with a set of abilities they can use regardless of what job they occupy as well as a set of passive abilities called job specialization talents that they gain when they occupy certain jobs.  At character creation, they begin with the ability to use their class's rank 1 ability.  When choosing your class, be sure to read ahead and think about what kind of abilities most appeal to you.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, before you move on you should give your character either a Lucky accessory or a Mystical accessory that has no attached upgrade that they can equip in their accessory slot.  See the Accessories section for more details.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Choosing Elemental Type</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's elemental type determines the elemental type of some of the abilities they gain from their jobs.  There are two different varieties of elements: primal elements and natural elements.  The primal elements are slightly less likely to deal significant damage than the natural elements, but also slightly less likely to be resisted to as great of a degree.  The three primal elements are Fire, Earth, and Water, and the six natural elements are Cold, Light, Thunder, Shadow, Wood, and Metal.  See the Jobs and Elemental Damage sections of the rules for more details.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Choosing Starting Job</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's job is a set of abilities that they can use during combat that determine what role they take during combat.  As they advance in Tier, characters will gain multiple jobs that they can switch between during the Paradigm Phase of combat.  Eventually, every character in the party will be able to use any job.  However, at character creation all characters start with only one job available.  See the Jobs section for more details.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Strikers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in dealing physical damage to their enemies.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Casters</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in dealing magical damage to their enemies.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Healers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in restoring their allies' HP and negating debuffs and status effects.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Defenders</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in drawing enemy attacks and negating the damage they do to allies.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Supports</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in buffing allies and applying Shells, which are a form of temporary HP.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Saboteurs</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> specialize in debuffing and applying negative status effects to enemies.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When you choose your character's starting job, they automatically gain access to that job's Rank 1 ability, which you should mark down on your character sheet.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each job grants extra bonuses to three different character statistics equal to their Body, Mind, and Spirit that are listed in their description in the Jobs section.  Whenever you take a new job, including now, you should note down the statistics that they give bonuses to.  When you calculate your statistics, you will take these into account.  Eventually, you will have separate sets of statistics listed for all six of your character's jobs.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Calculating Statistics</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At this point, you should now have enough information to determine your character's statistics.  Below, the formulae for determining each of them are given in shorthand.  To see them in more detail and learn more about what each statistic does, see the Attributes and Statistics section as well as the Combat Rules.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Health</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's maximum HP.  It is equal to [Body]x5 + [Class Bonus].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Initiative</em></i><i><b><strong style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> </strong></b></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">determines when a character acts during combat.  It is equal to [Mind]x2 + [Class Bonus].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mana</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's maximum MP.  It is equal to [Spirit]x5 + [Class Bonus].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Attack</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's base physical damage bonus.  It is equal to [Weapon Bonus] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Attack</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's base magical damage bonus.  It is equal to [Weapon Bonus] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Defense</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines the base reduction to the physical damage a character takes.  It is equal to [Armor Bonus] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Defense</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines the base reduction to the magical damage a character takes.  It is equal to [Armor Bonus] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Evasion</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines the base reduction to enemies' chance to hit a character when they attack.  It is equal to [Accessory Bonus if applicable] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Resistance</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines the base reduction to enemies' chance to inflict a status effect on a character.  It is equal to [Accessory Bonus if applicable] + [Job Bonus if applicable].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical Accuracy</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's bonus chance to hit with physical attacks.  It is equal to [Mind] + [Body].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical Accuracy</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's bonus chance to hit with magical attacks.  It is equal to [Spirit] + [Mind].</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Status Accuracy</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> determines a character's bonus chance to inflict status effects on enemies.  It is equal to [Body] + [Spirit].</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Creating Eidolon</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once you have determined every aspect of your character, you should now be ready to create their Eidolon.  A character's Eidolon is a godlike being whose appearance in the world is the most powerful manifestation of their magic.  Think of them as a combination between a patron saint and a guardian angel.  Each player character has a single Eidolon that grows more powerful as they grow more powerful.  In combat, player characters can spend Anima to summon their Eidolons.  See the Eidolons section for information on the rules for using them.  During character creation, you should record your character's Eidolon's name and appearance, as well as its statistics, which are equal to your character's base statistics multiplied by 5, excluding bonuses from your current job.  The exception to this is that Eidolon's do not have Mana because their attacks are either free or have an Anima cost.  In addition, a character's Eidolon has the same elemental type as them for the purposes of determining the outcomes of attacks and status-inflicting abilities that target them during battle.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are six classes of Eidolon, one for each job.  Your Eidolon's class does not have to correspond to your starting job.  Each Eidolon class can use the Attack and Full Restore abilities, and also gains two more abilities depending on class.  See the Eidolons section for more details.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Strikers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Cleave and Elemental Strike abilities.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Casters</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Magic Bolt and Elemental Bolt abilities.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Healers</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Heal and Cure abilities.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Defenders</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Shield and Barrier abilities.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Supports</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Enhance and Shell abilities.</span><br><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Saboteurs</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> gain the Reduce and Sabotage abilities.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Finishing Touches</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">At this point in character creation, you have all of the necessary information required to play your character.  Make sure all of it is recorded properly on your character sheet.  In addition, be sure to write down any other relevant information you can, such as their height, weight, gender, eye color, backstory, real and apparent age, and other character elements.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Finally, all characters receive 10 cr at character creation.  Players may use some or all of this to purchase battle items.  Whatever amount is left over after they are done purchasing items is carried with them into the beginning of the game.  Talk with your GM and see the Battle Items section to learn the kinds of items you might purchase in this manner.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Before you are finished with your character, go through the following list to ensure you have done everything.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Have you:</span></p><ol><li value="1" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Given your character a name and appearance?</span></li><li value="2" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chosen your character's Ideal and Shadow?</span></li><li value="3" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Set your character's Body, Mind, and Spirit?</span></li><li value="4" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chosen your character's class, and recorded its rank 1 ability?</span></li><li value="5" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded your character's weapon proficiency and starting weapon?</span></li><li value="6" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded your character's armor proficiency and starting armor?</span></li><li value="7" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Given your character either a Lucky or Mystical accessory?</span></li><li value="8" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded the buff and debuff associated with your character's class?</span></li><li value="9" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chosen your character's elemental type?</span></li><li value="10" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chosen your character's starting job, and recorded its rank 1 ability?</span></li><li value="11" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded the three bonuses to your character's statistics that their starting job provides?</span></li><li value="12" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Calculated your character's Health, Initiative, Mana, Physical Attack, Magical Attack, Physical Defense, Magical Defense, Evasion, Resistance, Physical Accuracy, Magical Accuracy, and Status Accuracy correctly according to the provided formulae?</span></li><li value="13" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded all of your Eidolon's statistics?</span></li><li value="14" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded your Eidolon's elemental type?</span></li><li value="15" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recorded your Eidolon's four abilities?</span></li><li value="16" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Written down your Eidolon's name and appearance?</span></li><li value="17" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Given your character 10 cr, and bought any items with it that you can afford?</span></li></ol><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If you have done all of this, then congratulations, you are now ready to play Last Odyssey!</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Classes</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">During character creation, every player character is assigned a class.  A character's class is an expression of their profession and their role in combat.  Your interpretation of what this means is somewhat dependent on the setting of your campaign.  In a campaign with a medieval setting, a Knight might be a literal knight, while in a campaign with a more modern or futuristic setting a Knight might be a soldier, a revolutionary, or a demigod sworn to defend the timestream.  In any case, once chosen, a character's class is not meant to be changed.  There is also no such thing as multiclassing.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's class determines their armor and weapon proficiencies, which are the type of armor and the type of weapon that character can equip.  It also determines the statistic that their Buff abilities in the Support job increase, as well as the statistic that their Debuff abilities in the Saboteur job decrease, and gives a bonus to a character's Health, Mana, and Initiative.  As you increase your character's tier, your class will also provide abilities that can be used regardless of what job you currently occupy in combat.  During the later tiers, your class will also provide job specialization talents to choose from, which modify their existing abilities while they occupy the associated job.  At tier 10, instead of unlocking a normal combat ability, you unlock a capstone ability that your Eidolon can use when summoned.</span></p><h6 style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In the final game, each class will also have a special expertise bonus, which they can add to force results related to their expertise.  In addition, they will have a special ability that only they can use when camping.</span></h6><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ranger</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Ranger is a scout, tracker, or member of a similar profession that has expertise in surviving in the wilderness.  In combat, Rangers wear light armor and use bows to do damage to enemies.  They specialize in improving their Accuracy with their Mark Target ability, and in dealing physical damage to enemies.  As a result, they work best in either the Striker or Saboteur jobs.  Their proficiencies are as follows:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Armor: Rangers are proficient in light armor.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Weapon: Rangers are proficient in wielding bows.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Buff: The Buff abilities that Rangers gain when they take the Support class affect the target's Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Debuff: The Debuff abilities that Rangers gain when they take the Saboteur class affect the target's Evasion.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Stat Bonuses: During character creation, Rangers get an extra +10 to their Health, +10 to their Mana, and +4 to their Initiative.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Abilities by Rank:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 1- Mark Target.  Ranged.  You gain an ability that has no MP cost and costs 1 AP that inflicts the Hunted status effect on a target.  When you use a magical attack, physical attack, or status-inflicting ability on the target, you may roll the 1d10 to hit twice and choose which result you prefer.  This does not apply to attacks that target multiple enemies.  Only one enemy can be Hunted at a time.  However, if you are the one to kill a Hunted enemy, you may immediately use Hunter's Mark on another enemy at no AP cost.  If the enemy dies to damage from any source other than your attacks, you cannot use Hunter's Mark again except as a consequence of Lay Trap.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 2- Forest Walk.  Passive.  The movement of a Ranger on the battlefield cannot be hindered for any reason.  They are also immune to any hostile effects that trigger when they move or that move them involuntarily.  Friendly effects, such as the Commander's Order, do not apply.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 3- Instead of an ability, the Ranger gains a permanent +1 to their Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 4- Instead of an ability, the Ranger gains an additional permanent +1 to their Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 5- Instead of an ability, the Ranger gains an additional permanent +1 to their Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 6- Lay Trap.  Special.  You gain an ability that costs 5 MP and 1 AP that readies a trap on either the enemy's front line or their back line.  You can make a free basic attack on the next enemy to move to that row as though they were Hunted regardless of whether they are in melee range of you or not.  If there are no enemies on the battlefield who currently are Hunted, you may choose to use Mark Target on them instead.  The basic attacks you make due to this ability can target enemies in the back row.  Enemies that move to the front row due to either side Advancing can also be affected by this ability, in which case you may choose which enemy to target at will.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 7- Cripple.  Passive.  All allies that attack a Hunted enemy gain the advantage of Hunted.  However, you must still kill the target yourself to be able to use Hunter's Mark again, with the exception of if an enemy is affected by Lay Trap.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 8- Instead of an ability, the Ranger gains an additional permanent +1 to their Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 9- Instead of an ability, the Ranger gains an additional permanent +1 to their Physical Accuracy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 10- (Eidolon Ability) Wild Hunt.  Multi.  Your Eidolon gains an ability that costs 1 Anima and 2 AP that applies Hunted to every enemy on the battlefield and then attacks each of them with a basic attack without removing it.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Job Specialization Talents:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Striker: True Strike.  Passive.  When you use a physical attack on a Hunted enemy, you may choose to remove the Hunted condition in order to ensure that the attack hits your target.  You may then reapply Mark Target during the following round.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Caster: Detonate.  Passive.  When an enemy is affected by Lay Trap, you may choose to immediately cast your Elemental Bolt spell on the enemy instead of using your basic attack.  When you make the magical attack roll for this attack, roll the 1d10 twice and choose which result you prefer.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Healer: Autodoc.  Passive.  While you occupy this job, you may use your Mark Target ability to apply the Watched condition to an ally.  When they drop to 0 HP, the mark is removed, and they are restored to an amount of HP equal to your Magical Attack </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">as a Healer.</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">  You may only use Mark Target on one ally and one enemy at a time, regardless of what condition was applied.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Defender: Forcefield.  Passive.  While you occupy this job, you may use your Mark Target ability to apply the Defended condition to an ally.

If the attack would target you as well as them, it is simply negated against the Guarded ally, and you are targeted as normal.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 3- Shield.  Self.  You gain an ability that costs 7 MP and inflicts the Shielded status effect on you.  The next time an enemy hits you with a physical attack, the damage they deal is automatically reduced to zero and you lose the Shielded status.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 4- Counter.  Self.  You gain an ability that costs 7 MP and inflicts the Countering status on you until the beginning of your next turn.  When you have the Countering status and an enemy targets you with a physical attack, they become the target of that same physical attack as though they had targeted both you and themselves.  If the attacker is using an ability that has multiple targets, they is the only additional target of their own ability.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 5- Multitaunt.  Multi.  You gain an ability that costs 9 MP and inflicts Taunted on every single enemy on the battlefield until the beginning of your next turn.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 6- Multiguard.  Multi.  You gain an ability that costs 10 MP and inflicts the Guarded status on every single ally on the battlefield until the beginning of your next turn.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 8- Reflect.  Self.  You gain an ability that costs 12 MP and inflicts the Reflected status on you until the beginning of your next turn.  If an enemy targets you with a magical attack, they become the target of that same magical attack as though they had targeted both you and themselves.  If the attacker is using an ability that has multiple targets, they is the only additional target of their own ability.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 9- Deathless.  Passive.  Any attack that would lead to you being downed while you occupy this job will instead bring you down to 1 HP.  If you are already at 1 HP, you are still downed.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 10- (Eidolon Ability) Mirror Shield.  Self.  Your Eidolon gains an ability that costs 2 AP and 1 Anima that inflicts the Mirrored status onto yourself.  Mirrored both negates </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">and</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> reflects all attacks and status inflicting abilities back onto the user until the beginning of your next turn</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Support</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Support characters are capable of buffing their allies, as well as applying Shells to allies that do not have them as well as healing Shells that they already have.  They can also use Haste, an ability that increases the amount of AP that allies have available to use during battle, making them indispensable in almost any situation.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Statistic Bonuses:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Support, they get a bonus to their Physical Defense equal to their Body.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Support, they get a bonus to their Magical Defense equal to their Mind.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Support, they get a bonus to their Magical Attack equal to their Spirit.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Abilities by Rank:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 1- Buff.

Ally.  You gain an ability that costs 7 MP and increases the Shell of yourself or an ally by an amount equal to your Magic Attack.  The Shell's elemental type is your base elemental type.  The maximum Shell that any one ally can have is equal to their Health (</span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">not</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"> their current max HP), and they cannot have a Shell of more than one elemental type applied to them at the same time.  If they have a Shell of another elemental type, that Shell simply goes away and is replaced with the new Shell.  Note that the rules for Shellbreaking apply to Shells placed on allies as much as Shells placed on enemies.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 3- Protect.  Ally.  You gain an ability that costs 9 MP and confers the Protected status on yourself or an ally.  A Protected ally that is hit by an attack that deals damage of your basic elemental type will not receive that damage, and the Protected status will go away.  Characters can be protected from all elements at once except for colorless damage, but this effect does not stack more than once.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 4- Multibuff.

They are almost always useful in battle, but especially so on the first few turns.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Statistic Bonuses:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Saboteur, they get a bonus to their Resistance equal to their Body.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Saboteur, they get a bonus to their Physical Attack equal to their Mind.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While a character is a Saboteur, they get a bonus to their Evasion equal to their Spirit.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Abilities by Rank:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 1- Debuff.

You gain an ability that costs 12 MP and gives the target the Slowed effect, which reduces their AP by 1 for the next three rounds after the round during which you use this ability.  Slow cannot stack, but any additional uses of Slow on an enemy that is already Slowed will extend the duration of the effect by three additional rounds.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 4- Multidebuff.

You gain an ability that costs 12 MP and moves all enemies on the battlefield one level down on the Bonus Tracker for the statistic that your class debuffs.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 5- Vulnerability.  Ranged.  You gain an ability that costs 8 MP and inflicts the Vulnerable status on an enemy without a roll.  The next ability that hits that enemy that does damage of your base elemental type will deal damage as though the target had a 2x elemental weakness to it.  Once the enemy has taken this damage, they stop being Vulnerable.  Vulnerability cannot stack, but enemies can be rendered Vulnerable to multiple elemental types at once.  However, they can never be rendered vulnerable to colorless damage.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rank 6- Power Debuff.  Ranged.

Run-of-the-mill abilities are powered by Mana, but the most potent form of magic is instead powered by Anima, which is the magical power inherent in the will of all conscious beings.  Anima finds its highest expression in the magic of the Eidolons.  A character's Eidolon is a demigodlike being whose power protects and is in turn fed by the deepest parts of a character's soul.  For example, a character who is kind and compassionate might be protected by a powerful dragon, while a character who is tough and stoic might be protected by an ethereal goddess.  In any case, Eidolons have two purposes within the game.  The first of these is to intervene out of combat in order to save characters from dire circumstances, and the second of these is that Eidolons may be summoned during combat in order to give characters an edge.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's summoned Eidolon has the same basic elemental type as that character.  Unlike the character themselves, the Eidolon's elemental type affects the damage that they take in addition to their abilities.  An Eidolon's statistics are equal to 5x the base statistics of the character that summoned them, including any bonuses from equipment but disregarding any bonuses to their statistics from their current job.  The exception to this is Mana, which Eidolons do not need to expend in order to use their abilities.  Instead, their abilities are either free or cost Anima.  They also have the same number of Action Points that their characters do.  When they are first summoned, they start at full AP and can immediately take their turn.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Anima</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In order to summon their Eidolon and to use certain abilities, character's must spend Anima.  Anima is an expression of a character's life energy, and can be accrued by acting out Scenes.  Outside of combat, when a character decides to put something valuable to them at risk in order to either be their Ideal self or their Shadow self, they may tell the GM that they want to act out a Scene, which is a dramatic cutscene that somehow either directly or indirectly contextualizes their decision and its results.  During a Scene, either the player and the GM or two players take the role of its two most important actors, but other players may also act as different parts of it as well, taking on the roles of supporting characters (including player characters if relevant) or parts of the Scene itself, such as the lighting, the camera, or the music.  A Scene ends once sufficient justification for the central character to give up what they are sacrificing is established, at which point all participants earn a single Anima.  </span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each player may initiate a Scene once per game session, although they can participate in as many Scenes as they like in supporting roles.  Scenes can be as abstract or concrete as player characters want, ranging from childhood flashbacks to confessions of love to arguments with God or with a pantheon of gods, but they always begin and end with a character's decision to risk something valuable to them, whether that be a relationship, a beloved object, a job, a title, or even their sense of themselves.  Once the scene is over, the GM rolls a 1d10.  If the result is a 5 or below, the thing that the player risked is permanently changed, while if they roll above a 5 the thing that the player risked is preserved as it was.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Players can spend Anima in or out of combat in any of the following ways:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In combat, they can spend 3 Anima to take the Summon Eidolon action.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In combat, they must spend 1 Anima per turn to keep the Eidolon on the field.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Out of combat, they can spend 3 Anima to summon their Eidolon to save themselves from true death.  If so, they will be revived during the next scene at 1 HP.  They must do this at the moment of their own death, and they cannot intervene to save any other characters but themselves.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Out of combat, they can spend 1 Anima to automatically succeed when they attempt to force a result (see the travel and puzzle rules for more details).</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Out of combat, they can spend 1 Anima to revive their Eidolon to full HP.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Eidolons in Combat</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">In combat, Eidolons are immune to all debuffs and status effects.  They may still receive Shells and buffs as normal, however, and are also still capable of taking damage.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As a character advances the Rank of their class and jobs, they unlock special abilities that only their Eidolons can use.  In addition, a character's Eidolon also has a basic attack and two more powers determined by said character's starting job.  Here are the powers that an Eidolon has when their character is Rank 1:</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Attack.  Melee.  All Eidolons have a physical attack that works the same way as their character's basic attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Full Restore.  Self.  All Eidolons can spend 1 Anima and 1 AP to remove all status effects from themselves and immediately restore themselves to full HP.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Striker:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cleave.  Multi.  The Eidolon makes a melee physical attack against all enemies in the front row.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Strike.  Melee.  The Eidolon makes a physical attack against a single enemy whose elemental type is the same as their elemental type.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Caster:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magic Bolt.  Ranged.  The Eidolon makes a colorless magical attack against a single enemy.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Bolt.  Ranged.  The Eidolon makes a magical attack whose elemental type is the same as their elemental type against a single enemy.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Healer:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Heal.  Ally.  The Eidolon heals either themselves or a single ally by an amount equal to the Eidolon's Magical Attack.  If the ally is downed, they are also revived.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cure.  Ally.  The Eidolon removes all debuffs and status effects from themselves or from an ally, including status effects such as Protected or Reflecting.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Defender:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shield.  Self.  The Eidolon reflects all physical attacks used against them back at the user as though the user were the target of the attack instead of the Eidolon until the beginning of their next turn.  Multi attacks target all enemies.  Attacks that the Eidolon has used against itself simply have their damage negated.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Barrier.  Self.  The Eidolon reflects all magical attacks used against them back at the user as though the user were the target of the attack instead of the Eidolon until the beginning of their next turn.  Multi attacks target all enemies.  Attacks that the Eidolon has used against itself simply have their damage negated.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Support:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Enhance.  Ally.  The Eidolon brings the Bonus Tracker of the statistic that their character's class buffs to +7 for a single target.  Once the Eidolon disappears, all targets of Enhance will be Hasted for three subsequent rounds as though the Eidolon has Hasted them on the round it disappeared.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shell.  Ally.  The Eidolon puts the maximum possible Shell of its elemental type on itself or an ally.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Saboteur:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Reduce.  Ranged.  The Eidolon brings the Bonus Tracker of the statistic that their character's class debuffs to -7 for a single target and also Slows them for three rounds.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sabotage.  Ranged.  The Eidolon makes a status-inflicting ability roll against a single target.  If they succeed, they inflict the status associated with their elemental type on the target.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When an Eidolon is first summoned, they begin at the amount of HP they had right before they were summoned.  At the beginning of each turn after the Eidolon was summoned, their character must either spend 1 Anima to keep them on the field or else the Eidolon stops being summoned and the Initiative order goes back to normal.  If the Eidolon drops to 0 HP, they are also unsummoned, and cannot be summoned again until after the battle is over.  When an Eidolon is unsummoned, whatever HP they had remains until it is healed by their character.  However, Eidolons do not suffer from Toxin, Frostbite, or Burn outside of combat.</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Equipment</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A character's base Physical and Magical Attack and Defense as well as their base Evasion and Resistance are at least in part determined by special items that they carry on their person into combat that represent their arms and armor.  By default, a character can wear three types of equipment: weapons, which give bonuses to their base Magical and Physical Attack; armor, which gives bonuses to their base Physical and Magical Defense; and accessories, which give bonuses to their base Evasion and Resistance.  </span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The potency of a piece of armor or a weapon is determined by its Quality.  There are four levels of Quality a piece of gear can have: Mundane, Rare, Expert, and Unique.  The first three levels give flat increases to the bonuses the respective piece of armor or weaponry provides to a character's statistics.  Quality also determines the total Upgrade Value available to each weapon.  In addition to a piece of equipment's basic stats, each one also has a number of attached extra effects known as upgrades.  Each upgrade has an associated UV number.  The total sum of all of the UV numbers of the upgrades to a given weapon or armor set can never be greater than its total Upgrade Value.  Mundane equipment has a UV of 1, Rare equipment has a UV of 2, and Expert equipment has a UV of 3.  Unique weapons and armor count as having UV numbers of 3 as well, but have additional unique upgrades that distinguish them from all other pieces of equipment.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Roughly speaking, Mundane equipment is meant to be used by characters of levels 1-4, Rare equipment is meant to be used by characters of levels 4-6, Expert equipment is meant to be used by characters of levels 7-9, and Unique equipment should be acquired by characters of levels 9-10.  The exception to this rule is accessories, that do not have UV numbers but instead each possess a single upgrade that either counts as Partial or Total.  Accessories with Partial upgrades give bonuses to a character's Evasion or Resistance, while accessories with Total upgrades do not.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">For the most part, Quality and UV numbers and total Upgrade Values will not be visible to players.  However, there are two reasons why they are relevant.  The first, already stated, is that they are a rough estimate of when to make them available to players during a campaign.  The second is that they determine the base cost to purchase them from a vendor.  The exception to this is Unique weapons, which should not be purchasable via vendors but instead should be rewards for defeating Villains or Monsters and for clearing Dungeons.  The formulae for calculating base cost for different pieces of equipment are as follows:</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Weapons:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mundane weapons cost 100 cr, Rare weapons cost 1,000 cr, and Expert weapons cost 10,000 cr.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each UV 1 upgrade multiplies the cost of a weapon by 2, each UV 2 upgrade multiplies the cost of a weapon by 4, and each UV 3 upgrade multiplies the cost of a weapon by 8.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Armor:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mundane armor costs 500 cr, Rare armor costs 2,500 cr, and Expert armor costs 12,500 cr.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each UV 1 upgrade multiplies the cost of an armor set by 2, each UV 2 upgrade multiplies the cost of an armor set by 4, and each UV 3 upgrade multiplies the cost of an armor set by 8.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Accessories:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The base cost of an accessory is 750 cr.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">A Partial Upgrade multiplies the base cost of an accessory by 2, while a Total Upgrade multiplies it by 4.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Weapons</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each character can wield a single weapon at a time during combat.  There is no such thing as dual wielding in this game, but characters can always swap out their current weapon for another one they are proficient in without any effort out of combat and with the Swap Weapon action during combat.  All weapons give bonuses to a character's base Physical Attack and their base Magical Attack while they are being wielded.  The values of these bonuses are determined by the weapon's Quality and Attack Type.  There are three Attack Types, Balanced, Physical, and Magical.  The corresponding attack bonuses each of them gives and the types of weapons that count as each Attack Type are as follows:</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Physical:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Lances, Swords, and Bows count as as having the Physical Attack Type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mundane Physical weapons grant a +3 to Physical Attack and a +1 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rare Physical weapons grant a +5 to Physical Attack and a +3 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Expert Physical weapons grant a +7 to Physical Attack and a +5 to Magical Attack.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Balanced:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Guns, Daggers, and Claws count as as having the Balanced Attack Type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mundane Balanced weapons grant a +2 to Physical Attack and a +2 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rare Balanced weapons grant a +4 to Physical Attack and a +4 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Expert Balanced weapons grant a +6 to Physical Attack and a +6 to Magical Attack.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Magical:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Staves, Fans, and Scepters count as as having the Magical Attack Type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mundane Magical weapons grant a +1 to Physical Attack and a +3 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Rare Magical weapons grant a +3 to Physical Attack and a +5 to Magical Attack.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Expert Magical weapons grant a +5 to Physical Attack and a +7 to Magical Attack.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Upgrades by Upgrade Value:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Variable-</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Keen.  This upgrade gives a bonus to either your Status, Magical, or Physical Accuracy depending on its UV.  UV 1 gives a +1, UV 2 gives a +3, and UV 3 gives a +5.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Extra Ability.  When a character wields a weapon with this upgrade, they are able to use a single flex power, job power, or class ability at twice its normal MP cost.  At UV 1, the ability is earned at of Rank 1-3 of the job or class that can use it, at UV 2 the ability is earned at Rank 4-6, and at UV 3 the ability is earned at rank 7-9.  Flex powers always count as UV 1.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Fast.  This upgrade gives a bonus to the wielder's Initiative score.  At UV 1, the bonus is +1, at UV 2 the bonus is +2, and at UV 3 the bonus is +3.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Sharpened.

You can hit an enemy with this attack multiple times per turn, but you cannot reduce its AP below zero.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Ambushing.  At the beginning of a battle, you may make a free basic attack against any target within range of this weapon's basic attack before the Initiative order is determined.

When you roll a 1 while making a basic attack with this weapon, you do not calculate damage as usual.  Instead, you automatically deal 99 damage to the target that cannot be reflected, negated, guarded against, absorbed, or otherwise modified, including by normal damage modifiers.  If an enemy's Shell is broken in this manner, all rules for Shellbreaking still apply.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Corrupted.  Every ability that the wielder uses that has an elemental type, status effects included, counts as having the Shadow type.

There are three types of accessories: Head, Arm, and Loop.  Characters may wear up to one Head accessory, two Arm accessories (one for both arms), and two Loop accessories (one on their neck and one on their waist) at a time.  Characters of any tier can wear any type of accessory, but characters may only wear a number of accessories at a time equal to their tier divided by two, at a minimum of 1.  This means that tier 1 characters can wear 1 Accessory at a time, while tier 10 characters can wear 5 at a time, one on their Head, two on their Arms, one on their Neck, and one on their Waist.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">There are no stacking Quality levels for accessories, but there are three unique variants of accessory for each slot.  Lucky Accessories grant a +1 bonus to their wearer's Evasion, and Mystical Accessories grant a +1 bonus to their Resistance.  In addition, both Lucky and Mystical Accessories can have the same upgrades attached to them, one upgrade per Accessory.  There are also more powerful Unique Accessories, but these do not give you bonuses to your Evasion or Resistance.  In general, characters should have access to Lucky and Mystical accessories at Tiers 1-5, while characters above Tier 5 should have access to Uniques as well.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Upgrades by Variant:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Lucky or Mystical-</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shield.  This type of accessory grants a +1 to one of your Defense statistics.  This effect can stack with other bonuses of the same type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Resonance.  When you are wearing an accessory of this type, when you hit an enemy with an ability of the specified elemental type, it hits them as though you had rolled a 10 regardless of what the actual result of your attack or status-inflicting ability roll was.  This effect does not stack with other effects of the same type, but you can have multiple elemental resonances at once.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Support.  Wearing this accessory grants you proficiency with a specified weapon or armor type.  This does not stack, but you can wear Accessories that give you multiple different proficiencies at the same time.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Volatile.  When you use an ability that costs MP while wearing this accessory, roll a 1d10.  If the result is greater than 5, the ability does not cost any MP, while if the result is 5 or below, the ability costs double MP.  If you cannot afford the double MP cost in the latter case, the ability still fires but you immediately drop to 0 MP.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Item Sleeve.  When you use the item specified by this upgrade that involves a 1d10 roll, you may roll an additional 1d10 and freely choose which result you take.  If there is not a 1d10 roll involved, it instead doubles the item's potency or adds an extra enhancement.  For example, a healing item that normally heals 10 HP will now heal 20, or an item sleeve for a Scan item might turn it into Multiscan.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Linked Ability.  When you are wearing this accessory, you gain the use of an ability specified by the upgrade for double its usual MP cost.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Mana Battery.  This accessory has a linked pool of 5 temporary MP that you can draw on while you are wearing it rather than your base MP pool.  This MP resets at the beginning of every battle.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Scanner.  While you are wearing this accessory, you can use the Scan ability without spending any MP.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Resistance.  While wearing this accessory, all elemental damage of the specified type that you take is multiplied by 0.5 in addition to any other modifiers.  This effect cannot stack with any other resistances you have to the same elemental type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Targeting.  This Accessory gives you a +1 to one of your Accuracies while you are wearing it.  This bonus can stack with any other bonuses of the same type.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Unique-</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Summon Creature.  Once per battle while you are wearing this accessory, you may spend 2 AP to summon the creature into the battle.  When it is first summoned, it will enter the Initiative order based on the Initiative rules, and can begin acting during the following round but can be targeted during the round it was first summoned.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Shield.  While you are wearing this accessory, you are immune to a single elemental damage type, not including colorless damage.  This does not stack, but you can be immune to multiple elemental damage types at once.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Targe.  This ability gives you the Block ability.  Block has no MP cost, but multiplies the damage of the next physical attack that hits you by 0.5 in addition to other modifiers.  If you do not Block any attacks before the end of your next turn, this effect goes away.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Soul Sink.  When you die while wearing this accessory, it will reconstitute you back to 1 HP, regardless of how badly you were injured.  However, after the first time you die while wearing this accessory, you cannot take it off again, or you will instantly and permanently die.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Chameleon.  While you are wearing this accessory, you can use the Dancer's Costume Change ability without spending any MP.  If you are a Dancer, this also reduces the cost of the ability to 1 AP.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Protection Against Monsters.  When you take damage from an attack made by an enemy of the type specified by this item, it is multiplied by a factor of 0.75 in addition to other multipliers.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Auto Heal.  During the Effect Phase of every round, if you are wearing this accessory you automatically heal for 5 HP.  If you are downed, this accessory does nothing.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Grant Edge.  At the start of a battle, if you are wearing this accessory, you gain a +1 to your base Initiative.  This bonus can stack with any other bonuses to Initiative that you have.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Absorb Magic.  If you are attacked by a magical attack of the specified element while wearing this accessory, you gain an amount of HP equal to the damage you would have taken had the attack hit you.  There are no accessories that will let you absorb colorless damage.  If you are hit by any magical attacks, you take damage as normal.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Reciprocity.  Any debuff, status effect, or buff that any character applies to you is also applied by you to them.  This includes effects such as Taunted, the Defender's Guard ability, and special effects like the Ranger's Hunted, but does not include abilities like Shells.  Any effects you apply to yourself are only applied once.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Example Accessories:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Pilot Goggles.

Most battle items reproduce the effects of an ability such as Heal or Restore Mana, while others produce effects that no ability can reproduce.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Party Inventory</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Carry weight and capacity are represented in Last Odyssey by the Item Rating system.  In addition to its effects and base cost, each item in the party inventory has an Item Rating that is an estimate of how much space it takes up during travel.  The Carrying Capacity of each character is the maximum sum total rating of the items that they can carry at once.  Each character's Carrying Capacity is equal to 10 times their Body attribute.  Unless otherwise specified, all battle items have an Item Rating of 1.  Travel items can have ratings of anywhere from 2-10, while very large or cumbersome items might have ratings of up to 100.  Weapons have a rating of 5, armor has a rating of 10, and each accessory has a rating of 2.  However, your equipped weapon, armor, and accessories do not count towards your carrying capacity, only extra equipment that you carry on your person.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">During battle, all of the battle items that each player has are shared between party members.  However, weapons and accessories are not.  This means that any character can use any item in the party's inventory, but cannot equip another player's held weapons or accessories during battle.  Once a battle item is used once, it is automatically expended and disappears from the party inventory as its material form is consumed to power the magical effect it causes.  Only battle items can be used during battle, but all items including battle items can be used outside of battle.  Unless otherwise specified, it takes a trivial amount of time for a character to use a battle item outside of combat, up to a few minutes.  When you use a battle item, you can use it on any character on the battlefield including yourself regardless of where that character is currently located.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Item Effects</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each battle item has a discrete effect that it creates during combat.  In theory, multiple items could lead to the same effect.  Rather than having a fixed list of items, Last Odyssey has a fixed set of item effects that could be caused by multiple items.  This is for two reasons.  The first is that the value of an item to the players is determined by what it does, and not what it looks like, and this is reflected in the item's cost.  The second is that the item that produces an effect in one setting may be different to its equivalent in another.  For example, in a sci-fi setting healing items may take the form of injectors or medkits, while in a fantasy setting they could take the form of healing potions or poultices.  GMs who are comfortable subverting these rules for the sake of improving the narrative should check in with their players about any changes they make to these rules, since they may erode game balance and thus interfere with the party's enjoyment of the campaign.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Every item's base cost is defined by its effect, how potent that effect is, and whom it targets.  There are three Qualities of item: Mundane, Rare, and Expert.  Whether or not an item is unique is a matter of narrative, not mechanical considerations, but any truly unique items do not have a sale value, since they are usually ludicrously expensive or priceless.  Some items have effects that depend on their Quality, while others do not.  In the rulebook, the former are referred to as leveled, while the latter are referred to as non-leveled.  If an item is leveled, its cost if it's Mundane is give in the description of the item's effect.  Each additional power level multiplies the cost of the item by ten.  For example, if the Mundane version of an item costs 5 cr, then the Rare version will cost 50 cr and the Expert version will cost 500 cr.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Leveled Item Effects-</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Restore HP.  1 cr.

Most items will have only one enhancement, since enhancements that change their target are mutually exclusive, but some extremely rare items could have multiple.  Each enhancement to an item multiplies its base cost by an amount given in the enhancement description.  The possible enhancements are as follows:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Target-</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">All.  This item affects all characters on the battlefield.  Multiplies base cost by 2.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Row.  This item affects all characters on a single row.

The pool of XP that a character has earned can be spent on making them stronger by increasing their attributes and unlocking new abilities.  In many other tabletop RPGs, character progression is tracked by levels.  Last Odyssey's character levels are called tiers.  Characters of a given tier can spend XP on four distinct improvements to their character: unlocking a new job or specializing in a current one, taking what's known as a flex power, adding 1 to one of their attributes, and advancing 3 Ranks in a job they are currently able to occupy.  The last two of these can be done twice per tier, while the first two can only be done once.  </span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once a character has bought six improvements while occupying the same tier, they are ready to increase their tier.  To do so, they must spend 3 Anima to summon their Eidolon and commune with them, either through using them in battle or praying to them outside of it.  Once this has been done, the character advances to the next tier.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The XP cost of each improvement a character buys is equal to the number of improvements they have already bought plus one multiplied by twice their current tier.  For example, at tier 1 the very first upgrade a character buys will cost 2 XP, while the last one will cost 12 XP.  Characters of tier 10 can buy improvements as normal, but are maxed out at tier 10.  If a character in your campaign reaches max level, this means that it's time for the campaign to wrap up and/or for that character to move on and be changed out for another one.  Every time you advance a tier, you also gain access to the class ability or stat bonus of the corresponding rank.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Advancing Attributes</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When a player chooses to advance one of their character's attributes, they spend the requisite XP based on the formula given in the introduction to the Character Advancement section and can then add +1 to either their Body, their Mind, or their Spirit.  The next time they take this improvement during the same tier, they cannot improve the same attribute that they did before.  The maximum value that any of a character's three attributes can have is 10, although there is no corresponding floor or ceiling on their statistics</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Advancing Jobs</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When a player advances their character's Rank in a job, they are now able to use all of the abilities associated with that Rank or lower while they occupy it.  Players can save up Ranks whenever they take this improvement until they are ready, but they cannot spend them except when they take this improvement again.  Unlocking the Rank 10 Eidolon ability at the end of a job's ability list counts as advancing by 2 Ranks instead of 1.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Unlocking Jobs</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Characters of tier 1-5 can have new jobs unlocked for them when their player takes the corresponding improvement.  When a character unlocks a new job, they become able to occupy it during combat.  In addition, they are automatically able to use the job's Rank 1 ability without needing to advance it with another improvement.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Once a player has unlocked all six jobs, they no longer able to unlock any more.  Instead, taking this improvement from tiers 6-10 unlocks one of the job specialization talents listed in their class description.  These talents are passive abilities that slightly change the way the job functions, and are only active while a character of the associated class whose player has bought the talent with XP occupies their corresponding job.  There are six talents available per class, one for each job.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Flex Powers</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When a character takes this improvement, they gain an extra ability called a flex power that they can use regardless of what job they currently occupy.  At tiers 1-5, characters may purchase the following flex powers:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Buff.  Ally.  When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  This ability costs 10 MP, and raises the specified statistic of the target by one level on the Bonus Tracker.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Debuff.  Ranged.  When you take this power, choose one of the nine character statistics.  This ability costs 6 MP, and lowers the specified statistic of the target by one level on the Bonus Tracker.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Bolt.  Ranged.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  This ability costs 10 MP, and makes a magical attack of that elemental type against a single target.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Strike.  Melee.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  This ability costs 10 MP, and makes a physical attack of that elemental type against a single target.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">After reaching tier 6, characters may also purchase the following flex powers:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Debilitate.  Ranged.  When you take this power, choose a status effect.  This ability costs 14 MP, and attempts to inflict that status on a single enemy with a status-inflicting ability roll.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Shell.  Ally.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  This ability costs 14 MP, and increases the Shell of a single target by your current Magical Attack.  This power works the same as the Support's Shell ability.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">-Flex Protect.  Ally.  When you take this power, choose a non-colorless elemental type.  This ability costs 18 MP, and makes you or a single ally Protected against that elemental type.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">You may take multiple of each variety of flex power.  However, you may only take one power of each elemental type or statistic of each of the four.  For example, a character could have Water Strike and Water Bolt, but could not have two Water Bolt abilities that were both flex powers.  Characters </span><i><em style="white-space: pre-wrap;">may</em></i><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">, however, take the flex power versions of abilities that they also have access to in a particular job, so a character could have Water Bolt as a Caster ability and Water Bolt as a flex power.  They would simply only be able to use the flex power version of Water Bolt unless they were a Caster.</span></p>
