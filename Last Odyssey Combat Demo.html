<h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Combat Demo Instructions</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Not all of Last Odyssey is complete, but the essence of time is its scarcity.  With that in mind, I have created the following document in order to simulate what combat will be like in Last Odyssey under the conditions of actual gameplay.  To run this demo, you will need one GM to control the enemies, and 3-5 players to control a group of player characters.  You will also need dice, specifically d10s, d4s, and possibly a coin and a few other miscellaneous types to simulate the Confused condition.  You will also need objects to represent each character on the field, as well as a way of delineating where the front and back rows are in battle.  I will provide stat blocks for enemies of tier 1, and later of enemies of all tiers, but each player will also need to create a character using the character creation rules outlined in the Combat Rules document.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Character Creation</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">When playing the combat demo, you should choose which tier you want characters to start at.  At tier 1, you should follow the rules in the Character Creation Overview.  You are allowed to ignore the parts that do not pertain to combat, and I recommend doing so for the sake of efficiency.  If you start at a tier higher than 1, you go through character creation up to tier 1 as normal and then do the following:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Upgrade your character.  Give your character all six advancements for every prior tier.  For example, if you are making a character of tier 7, you will give yourself six flex powers, only one of which can be a Flex Shell, Flex Protect, or Flex Debilitate, five additional jobs, one job specialization talent, 30 points to upgrade your jobs, and 10 points to upgrade your attributes. </span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Customize Equipment.  Give your character equipment appropriate to their tier.  Characters of tiers 1-3 should start with Mundane equipment, characters of tiers 4-6 should start with Rare equipment, characters of tiers 7-9 should start with Expert equipment</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Purchase Items.  Each character should be given an additional 500 cr multiplied by their starting tier.  At tier 7, you will have 3510 cr to spend on any items you can afford.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Setting Up Battles</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Common enemies are divided into two categories: Normal, and Elite.  Part of the purpose of this demo is to determine the contribution of each enemy to a combat encounter.  Right now, I estimate that five Normals make up a decently challenging combat encounter, and that one Elite is the equivalent of two Normals.  Boss enemies are meant to be a difficult challenge on their own for a single party.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">To create a battle, choose a number of enemies equivalent to five Normals of the characters' tier.  Be sure to note down their statistics, abilities, elemental and creature types, and item tables, as well as whether each enemy will start in the front or back row.  I encourage you to mix and match enemy types to see which ones work best.  Groups of enemies are designed to synergize with one another, but you can try out synergies between enemies of different creature types if you want.  Just don't change their statistics!</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Gauntlet</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Last Odyssey's combat demo is designed to test combat in the simulated conditions of an actual campaign.  While you can also run single encounters with these rules, playtesters should focus on running an exercise called the Gauntlet.  To begin a Gauntlet, choose which tier the player characters should begin at, and choose which tier they should end at.  I recommend not testing more than one tier at once, but if you really want to do a marathon session I won't stop you.  For now, the only possible Gauntlet will take characters from tier 1 to tier 2.  The GM should prepare a number of battles for players that reward a cumulative amount of XP that is enough to bring them from their starting tier to the tier the Gauntlet ends at.  Per the Combat Rules, each Normal enemy is worth 1 XP, each Elite enemy is worth 5 XP, and each Boss enemy is worth 10 XP per phase.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each Gauntlet the group runs is divided into units called Gauntlet Rounds.  The stages of a Gauntlet Round are as follows.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">The Battle Phase: During this phase, the players battle enemies chosen by the GM.  At the end of the battle, distribute XP and items to all players as normal.  Any players that ended the battle while downed will also receive injuries per the Death and Injury section in the Combat Rules.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Recovery Phase: During this phase, all players regain half their maximum HP and MP, rounded down if they would not recover to full if their recovery were rounded up, and rounded up if they would.  In addition, you can remove one injury from one player for free.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Shop Phase: During this phase, players may purchase custom items and equipment with the cr they have accumulated thus far.  They may also sell the items they earned during battle if they don't want them in exchange for their equivalent cr value.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">If players earn enough XP to buy character advancements within their tier, allow them to spend it during the Shop Phase.  In the updated version of this guide, I will supply sample Bosses for your players to fight after the characters have sufficiently advanced to be able to move on to the next tier.  In addition, each character should earn 1 Anima every three battles.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Feedback Guide</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">I will be present for much of the early playtesting of this game, and tabletop industry wisdom (and common sense) has it that face-to-face conversations with playtesters are better than written feedback with no corresponding conversation.  However, I will not be present for every playtest, and it is also imperative sometimes that I not be present, as this game is meant to be played without me in the room.  When this happens, the participants are allowed and encouraged to provide as much feedback as they want, but there are a few guidelines that I need the bare minimum feedback to follow.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Players should at minimum answer the following questions:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What is your prior experience with RPGs?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What was your character's class and job or jobs?  What was your overall intent with the build, if you had one?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How long did it take you to build your character, and how difficult was it to do so?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How difficult was combat for you?  How difficult was it for the party?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How did you feel during combat?  Anxious?  Thrilled?  Overwhelmed?</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">GMs should at minimum answer the following questions:</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">What is your prior experience with RPGs?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Report the Gauntlet you ran--each encounter, and its aftermath, including earned items and cr and character injuries.</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How difficult was it to run combat?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">How much did you enjoy being a GM during your playtest?</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">As far as you could tell, how did the players behave during the playtest?  Was there anything in particular you noticed?</span></p><h1 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Enemies</span></h1><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Each enemy on the battlefield has the same combat statistics that player characters do, as well as a set of abilities, each with their own MP cost.  Enemies can also take any of the basic set of actions outlined in the Actions, Turns, and Rounds subsection of the Combat Rules except for Summon Eidolon.  While some enemies in Last Odyssey will flee encounters, enemies should not do so during the Gauntlet.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">While enemies in combat are mostly the same as player characters, there are a few notable differences.  First, enemies begin with a Shell of their elemental type in addition to their HP, and this Shell can be colorless if the enemy's elemental type is also colorless.  Enemies also count as their elemental type for the purpose of calculating the damage they receive.  Finally, each enemy has a creature type, which is a single word that describes what kind of being it is.  Creature type interacts with a few equipment upgrades as well as a number of travel mechanics.  In the base game, there are ten creature types: Human, Construct, Fairy, Animal, Demon, Angel, Elemental, Undead, Dragon, and Horror.</span></p><h2 dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Tier 1 Enemies</span></h2><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Police: The police are deployed against protestors, activists, criminals, and anyone else that the government perceives as threatening the established order.</span></p><p style="padding-inline-start: 40px;" dir="ltr"><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Cop (Normal 1, Human)</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Elemental Type: Metal</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Statistics: HP 10/Shell 5, Initiative 5, Mana 5, Physical Attack 4, Magical Attack 0, Physical Defense 2, Magical Defense 0, Evasion 2, Resistance 2, Physical Accuracy 4, Magical Accuracy 4, Status Accuracy 4</span><br><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">Truncheon.
